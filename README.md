# NEAT-genetic-algorithms-learns-flappy-bird
This is my implementation using the python NEAT algorithm which learns how to play a flappy bird-like game. Below is a demo of what the code is doing. I have created a simple game using PyGame for the algorithm to learn, the input features are the current distance from the top pipe, the bottom pipe and the distance to the middle of the 2 pipes. The below video illustrates that the algorithm almost instantly learns how to play a game very similar to flappy bird. Later I plan to add some graphics to this project to make it more visual and fix some bugs when the code doesnt register some collisions for the agents when the algorithm runs. This is a really cool machine learning project to play around with and it demonstrates the power of machine learning.
